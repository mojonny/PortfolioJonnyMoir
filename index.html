        <p>I am a former engineer and teacher with degrees in B.Sc & B.Ed who is pursuing a career in 
          web development and design. I am located in Calgary, Alberta and am ready work in-person or

            <h2>Intro</h2>
              <p>Hi my name is Jonny Moir and this is my portfolio for design + coding.
              I am currently pursuing work locally and remotely. I am passionate about 
              designing solutions for diverse problems, helping others, working on a great
              team, and love learning. Please feel free to explore my portfolio and 
              if you think we would make a great team, let me know!

          <p>This section is dedicated to the resources that have helped me thus far in 
            up-skilling.</p>
            <ul class="gratlist">
              <li class="gratitem"><strong>The Odin Project:</strong> The foundations course was a huge help in learning how to use 
                HTML and CSS. My javascript skills are next on my to-do list, and I plan to return 
                to their specific projects to better understand best practices. I am also really 
                keen to set up animations for this site that make things look pretty slick! 
                Of course, the Full Stack Course is also on the to-do list.

                  [The Odin Project Foundations site link]</a>
              </li>
              <li class="gratitem"><strong>Mimo:</strong> Interestingly, their web development app has further 
                refined my understanding of HTML and CSS. Especially wrapping my head around flex boxes! 
                Just like default boxes, my brain is set to nowrap in regards to this topic.
                <br><a class="gratlinks" href=https://getmimo.com/>[The Mimo app link]</a>
              </li>
              <li class="gratitem"><strong>Coursera:</strong> Another great resource has been Coursera. Not only have I found and 
                completed the Google UX Professional Certificate on there, but I am also keen to 
                complete some of the free projects and potentially pursue the Meta Front-End 
                Developer certification.
                <br><a class="gratlinks" href=https://www.coursera.org/>[Coursera site link]</a>
              </li>
              <li class="gratitem"><strong>Google:</strong> How could I not give thanks to Google for creating such a fun and 
                easy-to-understand course on UX/UI design! I feel quite comfortable with Figma 
                as the current industry standard software. I also really enjoyed being so creative
                in the design process. I may never look at an app or website the same again!
