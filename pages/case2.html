            <h1>Creating this portfolio</h1>
              <img src="../images/welcome2.png" width="10%" height="auto">
                <p> I decided early on to learn both UX/UI Design along with Front-End Web Development. I thought 
                  that this would give me a fuller picture of what goes into designing apps and other interfaces
                  that a user might interact with. I also couldn't resist learning more about the magic of the 
                  internet!</p>

                <h2>UX/UI Design of my site</h2>
                <p>So, using Figma and support from my Google UX Design course, I designed up to a hi-fi Prototype
                  which is shared below. I found this experience to be a bit of a roller coaster as I was learning
                  the skills to make the site work while also not really know what I needed to share.
                </p>

                <h2>Coding The Site</h2>
                <p>I am very proud of what I have accomplished in such a short time! Although the site still has 
                  a simplistic design and functionality, it is slowly starting to take on a more professional
                  feel. I am hesitant to add many more animations and moving pieces as it reminds me of the days
                  of doing junky school PowerPoints or the dizzying experiences of Prezi's.<br>

                  <br>Currently, the site is using mainly HTML and CSS to look this good. I do have some Javascript running
                  for some interactive tables and such, but I want to make sure I fully understand my JS code before 
                  slapping it in here.
                </p>
